# Question 0: String Capitalization in C++

## Description
This project features a C++ program that reads user input and recursively converts each character of the input string to uppercase. The solution showcases the use of recursion and string manipulation techniques in C++.

## Key Features
- Recursively processes and converts all characters to uppercase.
- Handles multiple lines of input.
- Efficient string manipulation using recursion.

# Question 1: Max/Min Recursive Array Navigation

## Description
This project implements a recursive algorithm to navigate through an array, alternating between calculating the maximum and minimum values based on predefined conditions. The program prints out a sequence of elements during the traversal.

## Key Features
- Utilizes recursion to alternate between max and min operations.
- Prints out an array of numbers in a sequence based on dynamic conditions.
- Demonstrates recursion and array manipulation.

# Question 3: Path Counting in a Grid

## Description
This project features a recursive C++ solution for counting the number of distinct paths in a grid. The program ensures the paths do not exceed the grid's boundaries, starting from the top-left corner and reaching the bottom-right corner.

## Key Features
- Recursive backtracking solution to calculate distinct paths in a grid.
- Ensures paths are safe and within grid boundaries.
- Tracks all valid paths from the starting point to the destination.

# Question 4: Reversi Game Solver in C++

## Description
This C++ project implements a solver for the game of Reversi. Using a backtracking algorithm, it navigates the board, making optimal moves based on the current state of the game.

## Key Features
- Implements the Reversi game board.
- Uses backtracking to solve the game and determine optimal moves.
- Outputs the sequence of moves required to solve the puzzle.
- Backtracking Algorithm
